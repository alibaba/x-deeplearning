// The Protocol Buffer library uses the classes in this package to deal with
// I/O and encoding/decoding raw bytes.  Most users will not need to
// deal with this package.  However, users who want to adapt the system to
// work with their own I/O abstractions -- e.g., to allow Protocol Buffers
// to be read from a different kind of input stream without the need for a
// temporary buffer -- should take a closer look.

/**
 * `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
 * URL that describes the type of the serialized message.
 * Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
 * of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.
 * Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.
 *     Foo foo = ...;
 *     Any any;
 *     any.PackFrom(foo);
 *     ...
 *     if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
 *       ...
 *     }
 * Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.
 *     Foo foo = ...;
 *     Any any = Any.pack(foo);
 *     ...
 *     if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
 *       foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
 *     }
 *  Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.
 *     foo = Foo(...)
 *     any = Any()
 *     any.Pack(foo)
 *     ...
 *     if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
 *       any.Unpack(foo)
 *       ...
 *  Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
 *      foo := &pb.Foo{...}
 *      any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
 *      ...
 *      foo := &pb.Foo{}
 *      if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
 *        ...
 *      }
 * The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
 * 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
 * methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
 * in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
 * name "y.z".
 * JSON
 * ====
 * The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
 * representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
 * additional field `&#64;type` which contains the type URL. Example:
 *     package google.profile;
 *     message Person {
 *       string first_name = 1;
 *       string last_name = 2;
 *     }
 *     {
 *       "&#64;type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
 *       "firstName": <string>,
 *       "lastName": <string>
 *     }
 * If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
 * representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
 * `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `&#64;type`
 * field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):
 *     {
 *       "&#64;type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
 *       "value": "1.212s"
 *     }
 *
 * Generated from protobuf message <code>google.protobuf.Any</code>
